He met a fairy who told him to go towards the west, where he would find a lime tree with a nest of hawks. When the young hawks were learning to fly, he was to tie them together and ask their parents to carry him on their backs. The parents came to rescue their children and met the man, who demanded payment for his help. He wanted to be carried on their backs, and the parents agreed. However, the man tricked them and tied the young hawks again. The parents came back and begged him to stop, and eventually, they agreed to carry him on their backs. The man put three pieces of dried meat on his back, which gave the hawks strength to fly. When they were almost home, the man cheered and the hawks faltered, causing him to fall again. Feeling sorry for him, the hawks carried him home, and the man had to cut off his own flesh to feed them.

Th\u1ea1ch Sanh escaped, and L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng presented the snake's head to the king and was appointed as a general. \n\nLater, the princess was kidnapped by \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng, a demon with magical powers. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh witnessed the event, shot an arrow at \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng, and followed the blood trail to find the demon's lair. The king was grief-stricken and sent L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng to rescue the princess, promising to give her hand in marriage and the throne to whoever could do so. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh eventually rescued the princess using a sleeping potion and a rope, and later killed \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng. He also rescued the prince from the underwater palace and was rewarded by the king. \n\nHowever, the spirits of the snake and \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng sought revenge against Th\u1ea1ch Sanh and accused him of stealing from the king. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh was imprisoned, but the princess, who had become mute, regained her speech after hearing Th\u1ea1ch Sanh's magical flute playing. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh told the king about his adventures, and the king eventually pardoned him and punished L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng and his mother instead.\n\nAfter being freed, Th\u1ea1ch Sanh's magical flute playing helped to thwart an attack by 18 neighboring countries, and the king eventually abdicated the throne in favor of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh. The story of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh has many variations across different ethnic groups, and some believe that the origin of the story is theirs, with evidence such as the cave where Th\u1ea1ch Sanh fought the snake and the temple dedicated to him.", "Here is the combined summary:\n\nTh\u1ea1ch Sanh killed a snake in a temple and took its golden bow and arrow.

However, he was eventually pardoned and became a hero, thwarting an attack by 18 neighboring countries with his magical flute playing. The king eventually abdicated the throne in favor of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh.\n\nIn other tales, two orphan brothers caught an old man who promised to take them to marry two beautiful women. They befriended the old man's daughters, stole a fake fan, and married them, but fell into a dragon's and a rabbit's pit due to the old man's curse. Their wives helped them escape, and one brother became a hero, living with tiny people and helping them defeat their enemies.\n\nA man was lost and used a trick to get home with the help of hawks. In another story, Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u visited a tower, broke into rooms, killed a demon, and freed three imprisoned princesses, each giving him an iron ball with a gemstone and diamond. He later worked for a blacksmith and showed the balls, impressing the princesses and the king, who married him to the youngest princess.\n\nHo\u00e0ng t\u1eed ba-ng\u00e0y helped a princess and rescued her from being sacrificed to a demon.

He met a fairy who told him to go towards the west, where he would find a lime tree with a nest of hawks. He tied the young hawks together and asked their parents to carry him on their backs. After some trickery, the hawks eventually agreed to carry him home, but only after he fed them dried meat and later had to cut off his own flesh to feed them again. Despite some setbacks, the hawks finally brought him home safely.\n\nIn another story, a prince killed a demon that had been eating apples from the king's garden every year, rescuing a girl who had been trapped for three years. The girl gave the prince two hairs, saying that if he rubbed them together, two sheep would appear to help him travel to the upper world or the lower world. However, the prince accidentally sent the princess to the lower world. He met an old woman who told him about a powerful demon that would grant him a wish if he gave it a girl's flesh to eat. The prince fought the demon and rescued the girl, but got lost.\n\nMeanwhile, C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa was kidnapped by \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng, a demon, while preparing for a ceremony. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh, a brave young man, witnessed the event and shot an arrow at \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng's wing, tracking it to its lair. The king was devastated and sent L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng to find C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa, promising to marry her to whoever could rescue her. L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng found Th\u1ea1ch Sanh and was told about the arrow incident. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh voluntarily tied a rope around his waist and rappelled down into the demon's lair, rescuing C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa with the help of L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng's soldiers.\n\nTh\u1ea1ch Sanh continued to help the prince of vua Th\u1ee7y, who was trapped in an iron cage. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh was praised by vua Th\u1ee7y and went on to rescue C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa again from the evil clutches of Ch\u1eb1n tinh and \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng. However, after Th\u1ea1ch Sanh killed the demons, their spirits sought revenge and framed Th\u1ea1ch Sanh, leading to his imprisonment.\n\nEventually, Th\u1ea1ch Sanh was released and went on to play the king's flute, which was heard by C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa, who was still mute. The king called for Th\u1ea1ch Sanh, and he told his story, earning the king's sympathy. The king then punished L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng and his mother, but ultimately let them go.Later, the king gave C\u00f4ng ch\u00faa to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh in marriage, and they had a grand wedding.\n\nIn another story, Tai G\u1ea5u, a half-man half-bear, was known for his strength and bravery. He was the son of a princess who had been kidnapped by a bear. Tai G\u1ea5u worked for the king, completing difficult tasks, and befriended a woodcutter and a miller. Together, they went hunting but were attacked by a dwarf. Tai G\u1ea5u saved his friends by tying the dwarf's beard to a tree and then killing the dwarf, rescuing the princess and his friends from being kidnapped. He also killed a nine-headed dragon that demanded a girl's sacrifice every year. Finally, Tai G\u1ea5u was rescued by a crow mother and returned home, where he found his enemies fighting over the princess. He killed them, took the princess back to the kingdom, and was married to her by the king.\n\nTh\u1ea1ch Sanh's legend is also connected to the T\u00e0y people, who believe he originated from Cao B\u1eb1ng. However, there are also theories that the story of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh might have originated from the Khmer people's tale of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh killing a demon.

However, the spirits of Ch\u1eb1n tinh and \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng sought revenge against Th\u1ea1ch Sanh after their deaths and framed him, causing him to be imprisoned. The princess became mute after being rescued and the king invited various healers to cure her. Meanwhile, Th\u1ea1ch Sanh played the king's flute in prison, and the sound reached the princess, curing her muteness. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh was called to the palace and told his story, earning the sympathy of the king and his family. Eventually, the king had L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng and his mother arrested and handed over to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh for judgment, and Th\u1ea1ch Sanh spared their lives and allowed them to return home. Unfortunately, they were struck by lightning on their way home and died.\n\nLater, the king married the princess to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh and held a grand wedding ceremony. However, the princes of 18 vassal states who had previously been rejected by the princess became angry and gathered their armies to challenge the king. But when they heard Th\u1ea1ch Sanh's divine flute playing, they lost their will to fight. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh invited them to eat a magical pot of rice, promising a reward if they could finish it, but they failed and eventually returned home. In the end, the king had no son and abdicated the throne to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh. The story of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh has many variations across different ethnic groups, including the T\u00e0y, M\u00e8o, and Khmer people. In H\u00f2a An, Cao B\u1eb1ng, the locals believe that the origins of the Th\u1ea1ch Sanh legend are from their own region, based on evidence such as the phrase \"In the past, in Cao B\u1eb1ng district\", the legendary cave where Th\u1ea1ch Sanh killed Ch\u1eb1n tinh, the Th\u1ea1ch Sanh temple, and related customs and languages.", "Here is the combined summary:\n\nTh\u1ea1ch Sanh, a brave hero, rescued a princess from a demon, \u0110\u1ea1i b\u00e0ng, by using anesthetic and binding her with a rope, and then had L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng's soldiers pull her up.

He borrowed the king's sword and met the girl in a deep cave. With the help of a drop of heavenly wine, he gained strength to lift the sword and killed the snake, rescuing the princess. \n\nLater, Th\u1ea1ch Sanh played the king's flute in prison, and the sound reached the princess, curing her muteness. Th\u1ea1ch Sanh was called to the palace and told his story, earning the sympathy of the king and his family. Eventually, the king had L\u00fd Th\u00f4ng and his mother arrested and handed over to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh for judgment, and Th\u1ea1ch Sanh spared their lives and allowed them to return home. \n\nIn another story, two orphan brothers made a living by catching birds and small animals. They were tricked by an old man who promised to take them to marry two beautiful women, but instead, he used a magical fan to blow them to the top of a mountain. The brothers escaped with the help of a flute and befriended the old man's daughters, marrying them after stealing a fake fan. \n\nMeanwhile, a man got lost and couldn't find his way home. A fairy told him to go west and find a lime tree with a nest of hawks. He tricked the hawks into carrying him home by tying their young together and demanding payment. Eventually, the hawks carried him home, and he had to cut off his own flesh to feed them. \n\nIn the end, the king had no son and abdicated the throne to Th\u1ea1ch Sanh.

In these stories, heroes like H\u1edd-p\u00f4-tia and H\u1edd-r\u0103ng-san, Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u, Ho\u00e0ng t\u1eed ba, Tai G\u1ea5u, and M\u00e1t-xang venture into the unknown, defeat monsters, and rescue people in need.

Ch\u00e0ng G\u00e1u rescued the princesses, received iron balls with gems and diamonds as gifts, and eventually married the youngest princess.\n\nMeanwhile, in a king's garden, a demon would come to eat the apples every year. The third prince killed the demon and rescued a beautiful girl who had been trapped for three years. The girl gave the prince two strands of hair, which could summon two sheep to help him navigate the underworld or ascend to heaven. However, the prince accidentally sent the princess to the underworld, where he met an old woman who revealed the demon's weakness: it would grant a wish if it could eat a girl's flesh. The prince fought the demon, rescued the girl, but got lost in the underworld. The king sent people to find the prince, but they didn't find him. Eventually, a bird mother rescued the prince and gave him one of its wings, which could summon a dark servant to help him.\n\nIn another story, Tai G\u00e1u, a half-human, half-bear, was known for his strength and bravery. He worked for the king, completing difficult tasks, and befriended a tree puller and a miller. Together, they went hunting but were attacked by a dwarf. Tai G\u00e1u saved his friends by tying the dwarf's beard to a tree and later killed the dwarf, saving a princess and his friends from captivity. He also killed a 9-headed dragon that demanded a girl sacrifice every year. Eventually, Tai G\u00e1u was rescued by a mother crow and returned home, where he found his enemies fighting over the princess. He killed them, took the princess back to the kingdom, and was given her hand in marriage by the king.\n\nThe story also tells about a prince who helped a crying girl finish a wedding dress that could fit into a nutshell, and the girl became impressed. At the wedding, the prince wished for a horse that could jump over 15 holes, and a horse appeared, amazing everyone. The king asked who the prince was, and he replied that he was the son of the king. The story of the third prince eventually led to him getting married to the princess.\n\nAdditionally, M\u00e1t-xang, a hero with a bovine head, befriended three individuals: a black man born from the forest, a green man born from the grass, and a white man born from a crystal mountain. They lived together, taking turns hunting and cooking. However, an old woman stole their food and they lied about seeing a military procession to avoid responsibility. When M\u00e1t-xang was home, he defeated the old woman, traced her to a cave, and found a treasure. He took the treasure, but his friends abandoned him. M\u00e1t-xang planted three cherry seeds, wished for their quick growth, and slept for years. When he woke up, the cherry trees were tall. He left the cave and met his former friends, but instead of killing them, he traveled extensively and eventually ascended to heaven with an iron bow to fight evil spirits.\n\nOn a separate journey, a prince set out to find a white phoenix. Along the way, he met a knight and together they arrived at an empty castle in the desert. The knight went hunting, but the prince was tied up by a dwarf who ate all their food and escaped. The prince and the knight eventually killed the dwarf with the help of an old man sitting at the door. They then found 40 keys, unlocked the last room, and freed a beautiful girl who had been imprisoned since childhood. The prince and the knight were rewarded with riches and the prince continued his search for the white phoenix.", "", "", "", "", ""], ["Nh\u00e0 vua g\u1ea3 c\u00f4ng ch\u00faa cho Th\u1ea1ch Sanh v\u00e0 t\u1ed5 ch\u1ee9c l\u1ec5 c\u01b0\u1edbi tr\u1ecdng th\u1ec3.

However, the man tricked them and tied the young hawks again. The parents came back and begged him to stop, and eventually, they agreed to carry him on their backs. The man put three pieces of dried meat on his back, which gave the hawks strength to fly. When they were almost home, the man cheered and the hawks faltered, causing him to fall again. Feeling sorry for him, the hawks carried him home, and the man had to cut off his own flesh to feed them. Finally, they brought him home safely.", "Here is a combined summary of the two texts:\n\nA man wanted to go home but couldn't find a way. He met a fairy who told him to go towards the west, where he would find a lime tree with a nest of hawks. He was told to tie the young hawks together and ask their parents to carry him on their backs. After some trickery, the hawks eventually agreed to carry him home, but only after he fed them dried meat and later had to cut off his own flesh to feed them again. Despite some setbacks, the hawks finally brought him home safely.\n\nThis story bears some resemblance to other folklore tales about heroes who venture into deep caves to rescue people from monsters and get stranded underground for a while. Two such stories similar to the tale of Th\u1ea1ch Sanh are the story of the Gi\u01a1 tribe in Bengal about two brothers, H\u1edd-p\u00f4-tia and H\u1edd-r\u0103ng-san, who rescue a girl named Cun-g\u00f4-ri from a tiger's claws. However, she is later kidnapped by Cu-a-vang and taken to his underground village. The brothers follow her and rescue her, but face more problems afterwards. Another similar tale is the story of Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u in France, where a woman is captured by a bear and taken to its lair, and later gives birth to a half-bear, half-human child, who eventually escapes and returns to its mother's house.", "Here is the combined summary:\n\nA man wanted to go home but couldn't find a way.

One such story is about Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u, a strong and mischievous person who was kicked out of school and later became a blacksmith. He eventually went to a tower with two friends, where they encountered a giant who attacked them every day. Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u used his 500-pound iron staff to defeat the giant and earned his friends' respect. He then explored the tower, discovered a hidden passageway, and met a fairy who told him about a prison cell holding three princesses. Ch\u00e0ng G\u1ea5u broke into the cell, killed the demon, and freed the princesses, who each gave him a gemstone as a reward. He later met the king, the princesses' father, and became the husband of the youngest princess.", "Here is the combined summary:\n\nA man wanted to go home but couldn't find a way.

Despite some setbacks, the hawks finally brought him home safely.\n\nIn a similar story, the third prince killed a demon that had been eating apples from the king's garden every year, rescuing a girl who had been trapped for three years. The girl gave the prince two hairs, saying that if he rubbed them together, two sheep would appear to help him travel to the upper world or the lower world. However, the prince accidentally sent the princess to the lower world. He met an old woman who told him about a powerful demon that would grant him a wish if he gave it a girl's flesh to eat. The prince fought the demon and rescued the girl, but got lost. The king announced that anyone who could rescue the princess would be rewarded, but no one came forward. Later, the prince was rescued by a bird mother, who gave him one of her feathers, which could be used to summon a dark servant.\n\nThe third prince then helped a girl complete her wedding ceremony by getting into a nutshell, and the girl was very impressed. At the wedding, the prince wished for a horse that could jump over 15 holes, and such a horse appeared, astonishing everyone. The king asked who the prince was, and he revealed that he was the king's son. The story of the third prince ultimately led to him marrying the princess.\n\nIn another story, Tai G\u1ea5u, a half-man half-bear, was known for his strength and bravery. He was the son of a princess who had been kidnapped by a bear. Tai G\u1ea5u worked for the king, completing difficult tasks, and befriended a woodcutter and a miller. Together, they went hunting but were attacked by a dwarf. Tai G\u1ea5u saved his friends by tying the dwarf's beard to a tree and then killing the dwarf, rescuing the princess and his friends from being kidnapped. He also killed a nine-headed dragon that demanded a girl's sacrifice every year. Finally, Tai G\u1ea5u was rescued by a crow mother and returned home, where he found his enemies fighting over the princess. He killed them, took the princess back to the kingdom, and was married to her by the king.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], ["B\u00e0i t\u00f3m t\u1eaft:\n\nC\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u c\u00e2u chuy\u1ec7n c\u1ed5 t\u00edch v\u1ec1 anh h\u00f9ng c\u00f3 s\u1ee9c kh\u1ecfe v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ecbch chui v\u00e0o hang s\u00e2u gi\u1ebft qu\u00e1i v\u1eadt c\u1ee9u ng\u01b0\u1eddi v\u00e0 l\u01b0u l\u1ea1c \u1edf d\u01b0\u1edbi \u0111\u00f3 m\u1ed9t th\u1eddi gian.

The third prince killed the spirit, saved a beautiful girl, and received two magical hairs that could summon sheep to help him. However, he accidentally lost the princess to the underworld. A kind old woman helped him, and he discovered that the evil spirit needed to eat a girl's flesh to get water once a year. The prince defeated the spirit again, saved the girl, but got lost. A crow mother rescued him and gave him a magical wing to call for help.\n\nThe third prince later helped a girl accomplish her wedding tasks and impressed her. At the wedding, he wished for a horse that could jump over 15 hurdles, and it appeared, astonishing everyone. The king asked who he was, and he revealed himself as the king's son. Eventually, the prince married the princess.\n\nIn another story, Tai G\u1ea5u, a half-human half-bear, worked for the king, completing difficult tasks, and befriended a woodcutter and a miller. Together, they hunted but were attacked by a dwarf. Tai G\u1ea5u saved his friends by binding the dwarf's beard to a tree and killing him, rescuing the princess and his friends from capture. He also killed a nine-headed dragon that demanded a girl's sacrifice every year. Finally, Tai G\u1ea5u was rescued by a crow mother and returned home, where he found his enemies fighting for the princess. He killed them, took the princess back to the kingdom, and was rewarded with her hand in marriage.\n\nIn a separate adventure, M\u00e1t-xang, a hero with a bovine head, lived with three friends, taking turns hunting and cooking. However, an old woman stole their food, and they lied about seeing a military procession to avoid responsibility. M\u00e1t-xang defeated the old woman, found a treasure, and planted cherry seeds. He slept for years and eventually ascended to heaven with an iron bow to fight evil spirits.\n\nOn another journey, a prince sought a white phoenix. He met a knight, and together they arrived at an empty castle in the desert, where a dwarf ate their food and escaped. They killed the dwarf, found 40 keys, and freed a beautiful girl imprisoned since childhood. The prince continued his search, killed a giant, and saved three girls from an underground cave. He received magical gifts, including a bird, horses, and rings, warning him of potential harm from relatives.
